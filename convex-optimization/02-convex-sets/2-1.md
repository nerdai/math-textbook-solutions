# Definition of Convexity
## 2.1
Let $C\subseteq R^n$ be a convex set, with $x_1,\ldots,x_n \in C$, and let
$\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_k \in R$ satisfy $\theta_i \geq 0$, 
$\theta_1 + \cdots \theta_k = 1$. Show that $\theta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \theta_k x_k \in C$.
(The definition of convexity is that this holds for $k=2$; you must show it for
arbitrary $k$.) *Hint.* Use induction on $k$.

### Solution

**Base case:**

By definition of convexity, $k=2$ holds.

**Inductive Step:**

Assume this holds for $k=m$ for $m>2$, and prove 

$$
\theta_1 x_1 + \cdots \theta_m x_m + \theta_{m+1} x_{m+1} \in C.
$$

Let $y=\sum_{i=1}^m\theta_i x_i + \theta_{m+1}x_{m+1}$ (assume $\theta_{m+1} \neq 1$).
With some elementary algebra, it readily follows that:

$$
y = (1 - \theta_{m+1})\bigg(\sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \theta_i\bigg) + \theta_{m+1}x_{m+1}.
$$

Since $\sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i = 1$, it follows from the inductive assumption that
$\sum_{i=1}^m \mu_i \theta_i \in C$. Moreover, by definition of convexity, and
since $x_{m+1} \in C$, it must be that $y\in C$.
